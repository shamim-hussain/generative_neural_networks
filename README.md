# Generative Neural Networks
A bunch of experiments that I did on different Deep Generative Neural Networks using Keras and Tensorflow. All the files are in a ready-to-run
format. I included the weight files for quick testing.

I did not did not do much finetuning and the codes are written in a slapdash fashion. But I think most of the codes are quite self-explanatory. I only tried to test the basic ideas in a simplistic manner; good results were not my priority.
